NAME
	median - Calculate the median values for a set of groups

SYNOPSIS
	median < INPUT

DESCRIPTION
	median takes the first blank space-separated column values
	and the remainder as keys. It will then print the median for
	each key. As a side effect median will print the result
	sorted by the keys.

EXAMPLES
	$ cat <<EOF | median
	-10
	2
	4
	3
	50
	EOF
	3

	$ cat <<EOF | median
	+003  c
	.001  a
	-002  b
	+001  c
	-001  b
	+002  c
	EOF
	.001  a
	-001.5  b
	+002  c

RATIONALE
	Combining sort(1), sed(1), wc(1), expr(1) to do this is
	too much work to do on a regular basis.

SEE ALSO
	sort(1), expr(1), sets(1)
